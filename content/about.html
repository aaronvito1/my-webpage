                        <p class="AboutInfo">I am a recent graduate of California State University, Long Beach with a Bachelor's in Asian-American Studies. I have always pursued an interest in technology, like building websites, building computers, or even playing video games. Some of my other interest includes taking photos and dancing! <br>
                        During the current COVID pandemic, I was able to focus on learning different computer languages. Currently, I am building websites and adding it to this portfolio!</p>
